# React Native: Field Notes

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and test your React Native application using **Expo**.

---

## 1. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required project dependencies:

```
npm install
```

---

## 2. Start the Expo Development Server

Launch the Expo development environment with:

```
npx expo
```

This command starts the **Expo development server** and opens the **Metro Bundler** dashboard in your browser.

---

## 3. Set Up Your Mobile Device

To test the app directly on your physical device:

1. Download the **Expo Go** app:
  - **iOS:** [App Store](https://apps.apple.com)
  - **Android:** [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com)

2. Open the **Expo Go** app on your mobile device.

---

## 4. Run the App on Your Device

Once the Expo server is running:

1. A **QR code** will appear in your terminal or on the Metro Bundler dashboard.
2. Open **Expo Go** on your device.
3. Use the **Scan QR Code** feature to scan the code.

Your React Native app will now load on your device, allowing you to test it in your local environment.

## Notes

- Any code changes you make will automatically reload on your device.
- Ensure your phone and computer are on the **same Wi-Fi network** for the connection to work properly.
